You may permanently transfer all of your rights under this agreement, provided you
retain no copies, you transfer all of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT (including all
component parts, the media and printed materials, any upgrades, this license
agreement and, if applicable, the Certificate of Authenticity), and the recipient
agrees to the terms of this license. If the SOFTWARE PRODUCT is an upgrade, any
transfer must include all prior versions of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT.

If the SOFTWARE PRODUCT is an upgrade from an earlier version you may use or
transfer the SOFTWARE PRODUCT only in conjunction with that upgraded product,
unless you destroy the upgraded product. You may use that upgraded product only in
accordance with this license agreement. If the SOFTWARE PRODUCT is an upgrade of a

the SOFTWARE PRODUCT may be used and transferred only as part of that single
product package and may not be separated for use on more than one computer.
