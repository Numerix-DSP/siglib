          Signal Processing Library



INTRODUCTION

This directory contains the files for generating the siglib.def file that is used to
build the siglib DLL. Siglib.def is generated from functionList.txt.

functionList.txt is generated by extracting the siglib function list from libsiglib.a
using 'nm' and 'grep'. This functionality is implemented using the GNU Compiler
Collection (GCC) under Linux.

The Siglib.def file generation functionality is wrapped up into the batch file
DefGenerate.bat.

After generation the siglib.def file is copied to the /siglib/src folder.
